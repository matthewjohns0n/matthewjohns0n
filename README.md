### Hi there 👋

I'm Matt, a Lead Developer at [Packet Tide](https://github.com/packettide) specializing in backend development and PHP architecture.

I work on:
- **[@ExpressionEngine](https://github.com/ExpressionEngine/ExpressionEngine)** – Core team member
- **ExpressionEngine Core AI offerings** – Project lead on the ExpressionEngine MCP server, building custom AI integrations and tools with extensive work across AI APIs
- **[EEHarbor](https://eeharbor.com/) add-ons** – Extending the ExpressionEngine ecosystem
- **[CartThrob](https://www.cartthrob.com/)** – Project lead for e-commerce solutions
- **[Expresso Store](https://exp-resso.com/)** – Project lead for e-commerce platform
- **All sorts of things** – Client projects, server setups, contributing to product direction, and more

Always building, always improving the tools developers rely on.

Outside of code, I spend my time rock climbing, hiking, making music, and traveling as a digital nomad.
